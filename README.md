<h1>Truck Remote</h1>

<p>Welcome to my remote controlled truck project. This should work for most Tamiya style 1/14 scale trucks with 3 speed gearbox and a compatible ESC. Here is a short <a href="https://youtu.be/U8aeSS4Txb8" target="_blank">video of my truck</a>.

<p>The firmware code will work with a RedBear Duo controller and can probably be adapted to other controllers. <b>App</b> contains the source of the remote control all developed with <a href="http://thunkable.com" target="_blank">Thunkable</a>. You will need to change the hardware address to match your board. <b>Electronics</b> contains is the circuit board created using <a href="http://fritzing.org" target="_blank">Fritzing</a>.</p>
